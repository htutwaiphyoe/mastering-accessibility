# Reducing Motion

For many people, motion on a screen can [make them sick](https://source.opennews.org/articles/motion-sick/), cause seizures, significant distractability, and more. Fortunately, we have a feature in modern computing systems and browsers where we can make animation and transitions safer and more inclusive!

Reduced Motion was introduced a few years ago as a [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) CSS Media Query and platform setting. It is [supported](https://caniuse.com/?search=reduced-motion) on Mac and iOS, Windows, and Android. With the ability to add a custom toggle to turn motion on or off, that means you can safely reduce motion pretty much anywhere.

## Turning on Reduced Motion

On the MacOS System Preferences under _Accessibility > Display_, there is a toggle for "Reduce Motion". Turning this on or off will impact how CSS Media Queries and related JavaScript matchMedia functions in web browsers.

## Using safe defaults

When you write your code for animation/transitions that will need Reduced Motion, you can go about it in a couple of ways:

1. Non-animated by default, only moving if the setting exists and is unchecked (leveraging `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`)
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
    .mask {
        /* do animation stuff */
    }
}
```
2. Animated by default, stopping movement if the setting exists and is checked (using `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`)
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    .mask {
        /* turn animations off */
        animation: none;
        transition: none;
    }
}
```

It’s a slight difference. Only the first option will contribute to safe animation by default, no matter whether `prefers-reduced-motion` is supported on the user’s device.

## Example of the CSS media query

Here is an example of how to respond to reduced motion with CSS:

<StackBlitz name="web-platform-ypa7y9" view="both" />

## Example of the JavaScript matchMedia query

JavaScript also includes a function for matching the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. It is useful for times when your animations are created with JavaScript, video backgrounds, etc.

```javascript
  const motionQuery = matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)');
  let userPrefersMotion = true;

  function handleReduceMotionChanged() {
    if (motionQuery.matches) {
      /* adjust 'transition' or 'animation' properties */
      userPrefersMotion = true;
    } else {
      /* standard motion */
      userPrefersMotion = false;
    }
  }
  motionQuery.addEventListener('change', handleReduceMotionChanged);
  
  handleReduceMotionChanged(); // fire once on load
```
And here is an example using JavaScript `matchMedia`:

<StackBlitz name="web-platform-3p4auo" view="both" openFile="script.js" />
