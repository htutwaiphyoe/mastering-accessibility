# Wrap-Up

To wrap up our time together, here are some additional resources and thoughts for you to carry with you. I may add to this list over time, and please let me know if there is anything I missed!

## Notable design systems and component libraries

There are some promising libraries for speeding up development with quite a bit of accessibility built-in. You’ll still need to test any library you use and make sure the implementations are truly accessible–don’t just take their word for it. But we have way more tools available to us than we used to–and GitHub issue trackers for submitting problems that we find.

- [React ARIA from Adobe](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
- [CoreUI for Vue](https://coreui.io/vue/docs/getting-started/accessibility.html)
- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

_Note: I have not tested all of these libraries, so consider them a potential direction rather than a sure thing._

## Who to follow in accessibility

Here is a list of folks to follow in accessibility. It won’t possibly include everyone worth following, and now that Twitter (X) is a shell of its former self your mileage may vary. https://www.a11yproject.com/follow/

## Accessibility expertise: a way to stand out from the crowd

Today's job market is tough. Every applicant has varied experience to bring to the table. If two candidates have equal experience except one is stronger in accessibility, a hiring manager might observe an advantage.

I've recently seen some employers prefer accessibility certifications (IAAP certifications, Trusted Tester, etc.). I haven't personally gone for it as I have adequate industry experience (and I'm back in a general webdev role). For specialized accessibility roles, however, certs can be a way to stand out from the crowd in a competitive job market.

Find your strengths and bring them to the table. Find how you can improve access while getting results that move an organization's mission forward.

I want to encourage you to apply accessibility even if you have to swim upstream. It isn't always easy to do the right thing when entire organizations around you don't believe in it. But I believe in the importance of access, and I believe in you.

Thank you for joining me in this workshop!
