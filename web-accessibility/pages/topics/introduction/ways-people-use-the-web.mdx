# Ways People Use the Web

A big reason to incorporate accessibility into web design and development is to make digital experiences that more people can use. People have such varied needs and perspectives. It’s impossible to make something that will work for absolutely every person in every context. But we can do a lot to meet people where they are by starting with the basics.

Beyond the typical sighted mouse user–the assumed default–people use the web in many different ways. They surf the web without mouse pointers, and with Assistive Technologies like screen readers. Some people use switch devices with a limited set of keys, and other people use head wands, mouth sticks and eye tracking technology. Some people navigate only by voice. And advancements for new technologies crop up all the time!

## Myth busting about accessibility

First, let’s bust some myths about accessibility. 

Screen readers use JavaScript! Web apps can be made accessible!

That said, accessibility is not only for screen reader users, although they are important.

Many people navigate with only the keyboard, including switch devices. This means that anything a mouse user can do, a sighted keyboard user must also be able to do. Screen readers do piggy-back on keyboard accessibility, as we’ll dig into later (along with additional keyboard requirements). But the days of "screen-reader only" skip links and other "offscreen" interactive controls are over. Make them visible, too!

Navigating by voice is also a big part of accessibility. Fortunately a lot of the basics apply: semantic HTML including links that look like links and buttons that look like buttons, on-screen text, keyboard focus outlines, and more.

## Privacy issues and why we shouldn’t detect screen readers

A question I hear a lot is whether screen reader usage can be tracked with analytics. The answer is mostly no, and not for technical reasons. 

People with disabilities have made it loud and clear that they do not want to be tracked on the internet. The fear is they will be shut out of apps that _could_ be made accessible, and instead forced to use low-quality text versions that lack features and aren’t well maintained. [Marco Zehe put it well](https://www.marcozehe.de/why-screen-reader-detection-on-the-web-is-a-bad-thing/) when he said: 

> “Letting a website know you’re using a screen reader means running around the web waving a red flag that shouts ‘here, I’m visually impaired or blind!’ at anyone who is willing to look.”

It would take away the one place where blind people can navigate around relatively undetected. That feedback should be respected.

Gains in accessibility and disability rights laws have been hard-fought over decades. As technologists, we must do our part to ensure websites and apps are designed and built with accessibility in mind. Many of us are in a position to do something about it. So let’s do it!
