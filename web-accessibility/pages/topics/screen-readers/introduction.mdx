# Screen Readers

Screen readers are a type of Assistive Technology (AT) that allow people to both use and develop websites and software through speech-to-text. For many people with disabilities, screen readers are an essential tool for navigating the web day-to-day.

> Screen reader usage also isn’t limited to blind people. The technology can be useful in a variety of contexts, including distractability and sensitivity to light and motion.

As technologists, we can make a big impact on the accessibility of websites with Assistive Technologies (among other areas). In this section, we’ll dig into some of the basic mechanics of screen-reader software including how to develop and test effectively.
