# Setting the Language and Fixing Markup

One easy win you can do is setting the document language for a given page on the HTML tag:

```html
<html lang="en">
```

This will tell Assistive Technology (AT) what language a page is in, affecting how content is read aloud.

For sites with multiple languages, you can set the lang attribute value dynamically in a template.

## Element level vs. page level language

You might also need to indicate a different language on a specific element as opposed to the overall page.

Fortunately, you can reuse the `lang` attribute on a child element to override just that section in AT. This can effectively change the way text is read aloud -- for example, changing from an English accent to a French accent.

```html
<html lang="en">
    <body>
        <p lang="fr"></p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Try the rendered source of this example full-screen in a screen reader:

<StackBlitz name="web-platform-li6gwd" view="both" />

## Validators vs. accessibility tools

You might wonder whether it makes sense to use an HTML validator these days.

With a modern web stack including tools like ESLint, TypeScript, React, and more, it's become less and less important as our tools will warn us about invalid markup in development mode.

However, also with a big stack of components that each bring in their own markup and styles, it can be easy to lose track of the overall page structure.

You should definitely check your rendered page source regularly to get a sense of the markup you're putting out. 

Parsing 4.1.1 was removed from WCAG 2.2 since browsers and ATs are so much more robust these days. They clean up a lot of broken markup miraculously, and there aren't really accessibility issues stemming from this specifically anymore.

You should still run accessibility tools as part of your process to ensure your markup is well-formed and not creating any clear accessibility blockers.
