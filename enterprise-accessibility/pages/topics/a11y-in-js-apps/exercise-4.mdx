# List Reordering Exercise

Letâ€™s work on a reorderable list component where users can delete items. What should happen to their keyboard focus? Do we need to do anything for screen reader users?

For a solution approach, add React code to move focus to a persistent element near the deleted one.

For a bonus round: announce `${item} reordered` type of messages with an ARIA Live Region when the list updates.

This exercise can be completed in this codebase, or on StackBlitz. You can find the completed example in `/completed-components/exercise-4-reordering/`.

<div className="my-6">
    <ReorderableList />
</div>

<div className="my-6">
    <h3>Completed Version</h3>
    <CompletedReorderableList />
</div>

## Remotely-hosted version

<StackBlitz name="stackblitz-starters-t5k8kb" view="both" />
