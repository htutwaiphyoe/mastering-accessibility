        - Launching the VoiceOver Rotor:
            - With VO enabled, hit VO + U. Use arrow keys to navigate sections.
        - Use Escape to close as a convention.
    - Silence with command key:
        - Hold the command key while the screen reader is speaking to make it quiet immediately. Helpful for doing demos!
    - Changing screen reader speaking rate

## Windows screen reader interaction modes

While VoiceOver works with plentiful multi-key combinations, NVDA and JAWS on Windows work differently. With simpler key commands, Windows screen readers also have a concept of [_interaction modes_](https://tink.uk/understanding-screen-reader-interaction-modes/) that higher-level engineers should know about.

<div className="float-right border-2 w-fit p-6 my-6 ml-6">
    <h3 className="font-bold text-lg border-b-2 mb-6">A form example</h3>
    <label>
        <div className="mb-2"><em>First Name</em></div>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Rainier McCheddarton" />
    </label>
</div>

The default mode in NVDA, for example, is **Browse Mode**. This allows reading of content and cycling through headings with the H key, for example.

When you focus in a form input or contenteditable widget, the mode changes to **Forms Mode** a.k.a. **Focus Mode**. This allows you to type an `H` in a field and it will pass that character to the browser rather than announcing the next heading. The screen reader will go in and out of this mode automatically, depending on element roles.

You can also swap modes manually using the key command `NVDA` + `Space` (where `NVDA` is the `Insert` key on a Windows keyboard, unless it has been mapped to something else).

## Use role=“application” with extreme caution

⚠️ There is also the ARIA `application` role that puts a user directly into _Focus mode_. Be _VERY_ careful about using this as you will essentially strip away Windows screen reader commands and keystrokes will be passed directly to the browser.

Before going to this as a solution, test with users who rely on screen readers all the time. It’s too easy to get this wrong. So I want to give you the biggest of cautions when it comes to the `application` role.
