# Windows User Setup

If you’re a Windows user and you don’t already have it set up, take a minute to install NVDA. It’s a free, open source screen reader that you should use for testing.

## For Mac users

NVDA is still important to test if you’re on a Mac computer, since it’s so widely used and it works differently than VoiceOver.

You can install NVDA on a Virtual Machine using software like [Parallels](https://parallels.com) or [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html). Parallels comes with a Windows license, it just takes a little bit to install.

### Remap keys for Windows

With a Windows VM on your Mac, you will want to remap some of your keyboard keys to work better since a Mac laptop doesn’t include an `Insert` key. I personally use a [Microsoft keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/en/accessories/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) at my workstation, and I remapped the Control and Alt Keys to match the layout of a Mac keyboard.

Here are some tips on remapping keys: https://www.marcozehe.com/how-to-map-your-macs-capslock-key-to-a-nvda-or-jaws-key-in-a-windows-virtual-machine/
