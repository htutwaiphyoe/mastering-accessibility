# Discussion Exercise

Let’s take a minute to consider accessibility in our organizations (current, past, or future).

Say you’re working on a web app with heavy UI interactions in it, and you know there are some accessibility issues that could block someone with disability from using it.

## Consider these questions:

1. Who would you have to convince to prioritize accessibility? What motivates them?

2. How would you scope or prioritize your feedback to increase the chances of positive action being taken?

3. Is there anything you could do to change the accessibility issues? What steps would you take?
